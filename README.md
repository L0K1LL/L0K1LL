###  About Me
 
I started my IT journey with a technical course in Information Systems and Computer Engineering. Since then, I’ve gained professional experience in Helpdesk and Hardware repair. I’m currently working as a Local IT Trainee at Forvia, expanding my IT operations and support skills.

On the side, I’m launching a food business with my fiancée and studying game development in Unity with C# for fun.
